National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett on Sunday defended Donald Trump’s decision to fire Bureau of Labor Statistics Commissioner Erika McEntarfer, claiming the president “wants his own people there.”

Last week, a weaker-than-expected jobs report proved to be a sore spot for the economy — and the president. The Bureau of Labor Statistics’ monthly jobs report on Friday showed the US economy added just 73,000 jobs in July. The monthly totals for May and June were also revised down by a combined 258,000 jobs.

After the report was released, Trump posted to Truth Social that “today’s Jobs Numbers were RIGGED in order to make the Republicans, and ME, look bad.” Trump later announced he was firing McEntarfer.


Hassett did not provide evidence that the report was incorrect, saying on NBC’s “Meet the Press” that the “revisions are hard evidence” that the jobs data was rigged.

“What we need is a fresh set of eyes over the BLS,” Hassett said.

During an appearance on “Fox News Sunday,” Hassett said that if he ran the BLS and had “the biggest downward revision in 50 years, I would have a really, really detailed report explaining why it happened.” He claimed without evidence that there are “partisan patterns” in the jobless data and that “data can’t be propaganda.”
